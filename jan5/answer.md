Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

The Frontend (FE) is the part of a web application that users directly see and interact with. It focuses on creating a smooth and intuitive experience for the user.

User Interface

Frontend is responsible for designing and displaying the layout of the application, including buttons, forms, navigation menus, text, images, and overall visual styling. It ensures the application looks clean, responsive, and user-friendly across different devices.

User Interaction

Frontend handles all user interactions such as clicks, typing, scrolling, and form submissions. It validates user inputs, shows error or success messages, and provides real-time feedback to improve usability.

Communication with Backend

Frontend sends requests to the backend using APIs (usually HTTP/HTTPS) and receives responses such as data or status messages. It then processes this data and updates the UI accordingly.

Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

The Backend (BE) is the server-side part of a web application that manages data, logic, and security. It works behind the scenes and is not directly visible to users.

Server-Side Processing

Backend processes requests received from the frontend, applies business rules, performs calculations, and prepares appropriate responses.

Database Handling

Backend interacts with databases to store, retrieve, update, and delete data. It ensures data consistency, accuracy, and proper structuring.

Security and Authentication

Backend manages authentication and authorization, verifies user identities, encrypts sensitive data, and protects the application from unauthorized access and security threats.

Q3. Business Logic

Business Logic refers to the rules and decision-making processes that define how an application behaves based on business requirements. It sits between the user interface and the database and controls how data is processed.

Real-World Examples

E-commerce Pricing
Applying discounts, taxes, and coupon codes based on user type, location, or purchase amount.

Banking Applications
Checking sufficient balance before allowing a money transfer and applying transaction limits.

Food Delivery Apps
Calculating delivery fees based on distance, time, and order value, and deciding restaurant availability.

Business logic ensures that the application follows real-world rules correctly.

Q4. Client–Server Model

The Client–Server Model is a communication structure where tasks are divided between requesters and providers.

Client

The client is the user-facing side, such as a web browser or mobile app, which sends requests and displays responses.

Server

The server is a system that processes client requests, applies logic, interacts with databases, and sends back results.

Communication

Communication happens through network protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. The client sends a request, the server processes it, and a response is sent back.

Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

Three-Tier Architecture is a structured way of building web applications by dividing them into three layers.

Presentation Layer

This is the frontend layer that handles user interface and user interactions.

Application (Business) Layer

This layer contains business logic and decision-making rules. It processes client requests and controls application behavior.

Data Layer

This layer manages databases and handles data storage and retrieval.

Why It Is Used

This architecture improves scalability, maintainability, security, and allows teams to work independently on different layers.

Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is widely used as a backend language due to its efficiency and flexibility.

Performance

JavaScript uses an event-driven, non-blocking architecture, making it highly efficient for handling multiple requests.

Ecosystem

JavaScript has a large ecosystem with package managers like npm, offering thousands of libraries and tools.

Popular Backend Frameworks

Popular frameworks include Express.js, NestJS, and Fastify, which simplify backend development and improve productivity.
